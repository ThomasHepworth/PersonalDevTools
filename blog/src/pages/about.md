## Hi, I'm Tom 👋

I'm a data engineer based in the UK, spending my days building pipelines, wrangling distributed systems, and trying to make data behave. When I'm not convincing Spark to cooperate, you'll find me exploring the intersection of technology, art, and movement.

### What I do

By day, I work on data engineering problems—ETL pipelines, data quality, and the occasional foray into analytics engineering. I'm particularly interested in developer tooling, making data systems more maintainable, and the craft of writing good code.

### Beyond the terminal

My interests are eclectic, which is probably why this blog exists:

- **📚 Books** — I'm always reading something, from technical deep-dives to fiction. Currently on a classics kick.
- **🎨 Modern Art** — I have a soft spot for the German Expressionists—Kirchner, Nolde, and the Die Brücke movement. There's something raw and honest about that era.
- **🧗 Bouldering** — The perfect antidote to desk work. Nothing clears the mind like focusing entirely on the next hold.
- **💡 Learning in Public** — This blog is my way of processing ideas, documenting what I've learned, and occasionally sharing things I find interesting.

### This blog

Think of this as my digital garden—part technical notebook, part creative outlet. You'll find posts on data engineering, book notes, art musings, and whatever else captures my attention. The [mini blog](/notes) is where I dump quick snippets, useful links, and half-formed thoughts.

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about data, expressionism, or beta for that overhang you're stuck on.
