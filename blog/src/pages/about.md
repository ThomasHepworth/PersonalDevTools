## Hi, I'm Tom

I'm a data linker and engineer based in the UK, working for the Ministry of Justice.

I previously worked on [`splink`](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink), the open-source linkage library. These days I'm mostly focussed on address matching, building out [`uk_address_matcher`](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/uk_address_matcher).

I mostly post about data-y things here, but I also enjoy a good ramble about whatever I'm into from time to time.

### Outside of work

Alongside the technical posts, you'll also find the odd entry on books, art, and whatever else I'm enjoying at the time.

- **📚 Books** - I'm always reading something, from technical deep-dives to fiction. I'm currently on a classics kick.
- **🎨 Modern Art** - I'm especially drawn to the German Expressionists, including Franz Marc and Kandinsky, as well as the Bauhaus. The expressive use of colour to carry emotion is a nice contrast to staring at computer screens all day.
- **🧗 Bouldering** - The perfect antidote to desk work, and to bad posture.
- **💡 Learning in Public** - This blog is my way of processing ideas, documenting what I've learned, and occasionally sharing things I find interesting.

I'm also trying to grow my very own avocado tree. If that's successful, expect exciting updates...

The [mini blog](/snippets) is where I dump quick snippets, useful links, and half-formed thoughts.

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about data, expressionism, or the beta for that overhang you're stuck on. My social links are in the footer.
