I've been reading the Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde lately and reflecting on the role of art in society:

"Art is a means of union among men, joining them together in the same feelings, and indispensable for the life and progress toward well-being of individuals and of humanity." - Oscar Wilde.
