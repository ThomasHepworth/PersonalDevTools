## How posts are structured
- Each post is a Markdown file under `src/data/blog/`. Files should include frontmatter with fields such as `title`, `pubDatetime`, `tags`, `description` and optionally `featured`, `draft`, `ogImage`.
- The content collections and validation live in `src/content.config.ts`. If you change frontmatter fields, update that file so the site builds correctly.

Example frontmatter (minimum):
```yaml
---
title: "My article title"
pubDatetime: 2025-12-23T12:00:00Z
tags:
	- data-engineering
description: "Short summary for listing and og/meta"
---
```

## About page and landing page
- Edit the About page at `src/pages/about.md`. It's a simple Markdown file — update content and frontmatter there.
- The main landing page is `src/pages/index.astro`. This controls the intro text, featured posts, and overall layout. For layout tweaks, check `src/layouts/Layout.astro`.

## Local development
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Build & preview
```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run preview
```

## Deployment
- Deployment is handled by the GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and publishes to GitHub Pages. If you rename the default branch, double-check that workflow and GitHub Pages settings.

## Contributing / checks
- Run `pnpm run format` and `pnpm run lint` before committing. Content-only changes typically don't require changes to code.

## Acknowledgements
- Inspired by the Astro and AstroPaper projects.
